name=Surface Water Storage
qgisMinimumVersion=3.28
description=This plugin generates the inundation area and elevation-area-volume graph for an area.
version=0.1
author=Jo√£o Vitor Pimenta
email=jvpjoaopimenta@gmail.com

about=This plugin aims to study surface water storage,for large lakes and reservoirs, among others. It does this through two tools: calculating how the stored water occupies the area (by generating the inundation area polygon), and calculating the area-volume-elevation relationship for the area. All layers must be in a CRS that uses meters and the DEM needs to be hydrologically consistent (no sinks).
